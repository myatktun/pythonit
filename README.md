# About

Just learning python by solving my own problems.

This repository has python scripts that convert markdown to rst and html. Markdown and html
files are then synced with AWS S3 bucket.

Generated HTML files can be hosted using GitHub Pages or AWS Amplify. Currently, it is hosted
on GitHub Pages at [myatktun.github.io](https://myatktun.github.io).

## Pyenv and Python LSP Server

For pylsp to work with pyenv virtual environment, just set local pyenv version to both virtual
environment version and global version, by editing `.python-version` file or run

```
pyenv local <venv_version> <global_version>
```

Need to specify <venv_version> first, otherwise pyenv will default to global_version, and
require to activate virtual environment manually.

## File Converters

**Markdown to RST**

Markdown files are written in the format below.

```md
# Main Header

1. [Section Header](#section-header)

##### [back to top](#main-header)

## Section Header

* [Section Content](#section-content)
* **Section Content** <a id="section-content"></a>
    - foo
    - **bar**
        >+ baz
        >1\. qux

##### [back to top](#main-header)
```

The converted rst files will be in the format below.

```rst
===========
Main Header
===========

1. `Section Header`_

`back to top <#main-header>`_

Section Header
==============

* `Section Content`_

Section Content
---------------
    * foo
    * **bar**
        - baz
        #. qux

`back to top <#main-header>`_
```

**RST to HTML**

rst files are converted to html using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

## Environment Variables

Only necessary to set to run [update_data.py](./src/update_data.py) script.

To sync files with S3, set environment variables for `LOCAL_MD_DIR`, `S3_MD_BUCKET`,
`LOCAL_HTML_DIR`, and `S3_HTML_BUCKET`.

To convert markdown to rst, set environment variables for `LOCAL_MD_DIR` and `LOCAL_RST_DIR`.

To push HTML files to GitHub repository, set environment variables for `GH_REPO`.

## Hosting Static Website with GitHub Pages

Create a public repository with the name `<username>.github.io`, and push html files to it.

In this setup, I just copy all files generated by Sphinx html build into the local repository,
and push it to the remote.

For Sphinx html themes to work, I had to push `.nojekyll` file to the repository. Do not know
what it does, and the file is empty.

## Hosting Static Website with AWS S3 and Amplify

Instead of having a public repository on GitHub Pages, html files in the S3 bucket can also be
hosted using AWS Amplify.

Right now, I haven't figured out how to create and host using AWS CLI. The only workaround is
to zip all the html files, sync it to S3 and use it in the `aws amplify` command

S3 bucket need to have certain policies to allow Amplify to get objects while public access is
blocked. As a reference, I have provided the bucket policy template generated when the site is
manually deployed using Amplify Console.

Create an Amplify app, and it will output an `<app-id>` to be used in other commands.

```sh
aws amplify create-app --name <app-name> --region <region-id>
```

Create a branch for the Amplify app.

```sh
aws amplify create-branch \
--region <region-id> \
--app-id <app-id> \
--branch-name <branch-name>
```

Update the S3 bucket policy in S3 Console using the template below. Edit `<branch-name>`,
`<bucket-name>`, `<account-id>`, `<region-id>`, and use the `<app-id>` generated from
`aws amplify create-app` command. Can manually update the policy in S3 Console, or put the
policy in json file, and use AWS CLI.

```json

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "amplify.amazonaws.com"
            },

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAmplifyToReadPrefix_<app-id>_<branch-name>_",
            "Effect": "Allow",

            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
            "Condition": {

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

```sh
aws s3api put-bucket-policy \
--bucket <bucket-name> \
--region <region-id> \
--policy file://<file-name>.json
```

Start Amplify deployment. You can also create it first.

```sh
aws amplify start-deployment \
--region <region-id> \
--app-id <app-id> \
--branch-name <branch-name> \
--source-url s3://<bucket-name>/<zip-file>
```

Can delete the Amplify app if no longer want it anymore.

```sh
aws amplify delete-app --app-id <app-id>
```
